# 3D_Genome
### 3D-Genome project is a summer internship project

#### Main concepts

#### Data source

#### Scripts
- **iterative_normalization.py** is a script that performs normalization in each chrom_pair interchromosomal contact matrices

- **concatenate_data.py** is a script that look at the contact values frequences in the whole genome, calculate the threshold value for the one percent top-interactions (the most tight) and keep only those that bigger than this threshold

works with raw and normalized data

- **jaccard_similarity.py**

- **take_a_closer_look.py**
